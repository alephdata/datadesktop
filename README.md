# Aleph Data Desktop

**Data Desktop** is a tool for visualizing and exploring complex networks.

It is built with investigative reporting as its primary use case and utilizes the [Follow the Money](https://github.com/alephdata/followthemoney) data model, which seeks to provide a common language to describe the entities most commonly used in investigative reporting.
